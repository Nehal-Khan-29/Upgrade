# Upgrade
Recommender system using ML-KNN algorithm to improve students learning experiences 

The critical challenge is to identify the effective methods to enhance student learning outcomes. Some students learn from their mistakes, but the question is how they can be guided to do so efficiently. Without a proper guidance, students may choose less effective ways to correct their errors. Thus losing their chance to gain more marks. Hence there is a need to have a recommender system that can improve students learning experience.
